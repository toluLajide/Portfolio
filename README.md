# Analysis of Student Performance

Subtitle

### Project Overview
This data analysis aims to provide insights into student performance by analyzing vavrious aspects of the student data in order to identify trends and the biggest predictors of academic success.

### Data Sources
The primary source for this analysis is the 'Student_performance_dataset_.csv' file which contains data of various students including academic and non-academic attriibutes.
The file was acquired from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/students-performance-dataset)

### Tools
Excel - Data Cleaning and Analysis: (File)

### Data Cleaning
In the intitial data preparation phase I:
- Data Loading and Inspection: Inspected the dataset for any inconsistencies, data types, and overall structure.
- Handling Missing Values: Imputed missing data by replacing them with the mean or median values, where applicable, to avoid data loss.
- Data Formatting: Reformatted columns to ensure consistency, particularly for date and numerical fields.
- Converting Categorical Variables: Converted categorical variables represented by numbers (such as gender or ethnicity) into descriptive text for clarity.

### Explanatory Data Analysis
EDA involving exploring the performance questions such as:
- What characteristics does the average student has
- What effect do absences have on gpa
- What are the top 5 determinants of gpa performance

The histogram above shows the distribution of gpa across all the students in the dataset. It shows that average students gpa tends to be around 1.0 to 3.0 with exceptionally good students getting 3.6 and above.

The graph above shows the negative correlation between absences and gpa where about 1 absence can lead to a .1 decrease in gpa
Data Analysis 

Results
- Key Predictors of GPA: Attendance, study time, and parental education level emerged as the strongest predictors of GPA.
- Absenteeism Impact: The data showed a clear trend where increased absences led to lower academic performance.
